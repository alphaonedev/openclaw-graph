# Stream Processing

## Purpose
Process continuous data streams in real-time using frameworks like Kafka and Flink for efficient data engineering.

## When to Use
- for real-time data ingestion and analytics
- in event-driven architectures
- for IoT and log processing pipelines

## Key Capabilities
- handle high-volume unbounded data streams
- perform windowing and aggregations
- ensure fault-tolerant distributed processing
