# Edge Computing

## Purpose
Process data at the network edge near IoT devices to minimize latency and bandwidth

## When to Use
- When implementing edge computing for IoT
- For low-latency data processing and integration

## Key Capabilities
- Full edge computing APIs/SDKs like AWS Greengrass
- Docker containerization for edge devices
- Networking optimizations and best practices
- Integration patterns for real-time IoT data
