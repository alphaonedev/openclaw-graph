# Procedural Generation

## Purpose
Algorithmic technique for generating game content like terrains and levels using noise functions and rules.

## When to Use
- Generating infinite game worlds
- Creating dynamic levels for replayability
- Optimizing content for indie games

## Key Capabilities
- Generate terrains with noise functions
- Create procedural assets and levels
- Enhance game variability algorithmically
