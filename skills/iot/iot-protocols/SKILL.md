# Iot Protocols

## Purpose
IoT protocols: Zigbee (mesh), Z-Wave (home), LoRaWAN (long-range), CoAP (lightweight), Matter (interoperable), Thread (I

## When to Use
- When working with IoT protocols
- For integration of Zigbee, Z-Wave, etc.

## Key Capabilities
- Full IoT protocols API/SDK access (e.g., Zigbee libraries)
- Secure integration patterns
- Best practices for low-power, wireless networks
