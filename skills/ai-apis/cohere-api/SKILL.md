# Cohere Api

## Purpose
Cohere API for embeddings, RAG, reranking, and semantic search.

## When to Use
- Generate embeddings with embed-v3,- Build RAG systems using command-r+,- Enhance search via reranking,- Perform semantic search on datasets,- Create enterprise AI pipelines

## Key Capabilities
- Embed-v3 for high-quality embeddings,- Command-r+ for RAG and chat applications,- Reranking to improve result relevance,- Semantic search for intelligent querying,- Enterprise pipelines for scalable AI
