# Shader Programming

## Purpose
Writing and optimizing GLSL or HLSL shaders for real-time graphics rendering in game engines.

## When to Use
- When creating custom visual effects in game engines
- For optimizing GPU performance in graphics pipelines
- In developing shaders for real-time applications like games

## Key Capabilities
- Write and compile vertex, fragment, and compute shaders
- Implement advanced lighting, texturing, and effects
- Debug and profile shaders for performance tuning
