# Sensor Fusion

## Purpose
Combining IoT sensor data using algorithms like Kalman filters for improved accuracy and reliability

## When to Use
- When working with sensor-fusion
- When sensor-fusion integration is needed for IoT

## Key Capabilities
- Full sensor-fusion API/SDK access including Kalman and particle filters
- Integration patterns for real-time IoT data merging
- Best practices for noise reduction and multi-sensor synchronization
